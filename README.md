### Yeison Montoya ID: 300375916

This Space has been created to share some examples of the seminar given in the Special Topics in Data Analytics CSIS 4260 - 002 Winter 2024 at Douglas College


## Seminar 1
Structured Data Mining:

- Tracking Patterns
- Classification
- Association
- Outlier Detection
- Clustering
- Regression
- Prediction
- Decision Trees
- Neural Networks
- Time Series Analysis
    
**Random Forest Algorithm:** Random Forest is an ensemble learning algorithm that combines the strength of multiple decision trees to enhance the overall predictive accuracy and robustness of the model. It falls under the category of supervised machine learning and is utilized for both classification and regression tasks.

## Seminar 2
Unstructured Data Mining (web mining) - Hyperlink-Induced Topic Search (HITS), also known as the Hubs and Authorities algorithm, is a link analysis algorithm that assigns two scores to each page: Hub score and Authority score. It evaluates the importance of web pages based on the structure of the hyperlink graph.

## Seminar 3
Text mining, a dynamic field within natural language processing, involves nuanced analysis of textual data. Major areas include:

- **Social Media Evaluation:** Unraveling sentiments and trends.
- **Semantic Analysis:** Deciphering word meanings for context.
- **Chatbots:** Enhancing responsiveness through text mining.
- **Deep Learning for Text Analysis:** Empowering pattern discernment.
- **Machine Translation:** Facilitating language translation.
- **Text Generation:** Contributing to content creation.
- **Information Extraction/Sentiment Analysis:** Discerning emotions and extracting insights.

In these domains, text mining is a potent tool for extracting valuable insights from vast textual information.

## Seminar 4

Big Data introduces a host of intricate challenges in terms of data generation, storage, and retrieval, as emphasized by Piety (2019). Addressing these challenges necessitates strategic approaches to unlock the potential inherent in extensive and varied datasets. The complexities involve efficiently handling diverse data types, particularly with the surge of information from sources like IoT and social media (Laney 2001). 

Furthermore, the substantial volume of data requires scalable storage solutions that often surpass the capabilities of traditional databases. Quick and seamless access to relevant information is paramount for optimal functionality, necessitating systems tailored to retrieve data from repositories without compromising performance. In light of these challenges, this document aims to delineate key issues and propose strategies for data generation, storage, and retrieval. 

It also advocates for the adoption of DynamoDB, an AWS-backed framework renowned for its competence in building technology stacks for managing large datasets at an affordable cost.
